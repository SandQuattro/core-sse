# Core SSE Demo API
#### Version 1.0

## Common

### About service
The Core SSE Demo API (here and after referred to as *API*) provides a set of methods necessary for multiple file uploading and
upload process Server Sent Events (SSE) streaming to frontend application. Can be useful for realtime data visualization, like file upload / processing progress, currency rates, etc.. It's one way, from server to client. If you need two-way communication, use websockets.

### Technologies:

Microservice core: Echo web microframework v4

Authorization: JWT token, public key verification, jwt parsing / validation

Integrations: HugginigFace Llama2 in this demo only, OpenAI, SberGigaChat and many more can be added easily

Configuration: Hocon config

Logging: LogDoc logging subsystem

Migrations: golang-migrate

Communication Bus: Asynq (Redis-based async queue) for incidents notification by telegram, sending emails, etc. 

Database: Postgres, using sqlx

Can be deployed to Docker, Dockerfile included

Observalibity: 

- Opentracing to Jaeger UI or my custom trace collector with LogDoc trace processing
- Prometheus metrics (golang standart + custom business metrics) with Grafana visualization
- LogDoc logging visualization
- Asynq queue monitoring using asynqmon
